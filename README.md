Installatron Custom Code
========================

We use the [Installatron](http://installatron.com/) plugin with the Domain of One's Own project to provide an easy way for users on the system to install a variety of open-source software. Installatron has [great documentation](http://installatron.com/developer/customization) for customizing the install process and hooking into that functionality which we've used to setup packages of plugins and themes in Wordpress as well as write install information to a separate community Wordpress install.
